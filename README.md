# Impact Helper Script

## Usage

### Recommended Method

The preferred way to include the Impact helper script is to reference it directly from the Impact CDN:

```html
<script src="https://impact.naudata.ch/embed"></script>
```

This ensures you always have the latest version with automatic updates and optimal performance.

### Alternative Method (Not Recommended)

If you need to self-host the script, you can copy the contents of `helper.js` from this repository and include it in your project. However, this method is **not recommended** because:

- You won't receive automatic updates
- You're responsible for manually updating the script
- You may miss important bug fixes and new features
